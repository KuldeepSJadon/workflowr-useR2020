Completing the tutorial requires two online services:

* [GitHub][] - Website for storing and sharing code in Git repositories
* [RStudio Cloud][rscloud] - Cloud version of RStudio IDE in which you can
create and share data science projects


[GitHub]: https://github.com/
[rscloud]: https://rstudio.cloud/

Prior to the tutorial, please create an account on both GitHub and RStudio Cloud.

## Create an account on GitHub

To create a new account on GitHub, go to https://github.com/join/. The only
requirement is a valid email address. The standard "Free" account is sufficient
for the tutorial. For more details, see the GitHub Help article
[Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Create an account on RStudio Cloud

To create an account on RStudio Cloud, go to
https://login.rstudio.cloud/register/. You can either create a new username and
password, or you can use your Google or GitHub credentials. I recommend using
your GitHub account for authentication on RStudio Cloud. The standard "Free"
plan is sufficient for this tutorial.

If you do use an email address to create your account, you will need to verify
your email address by clicking on the link in the email sent by RStudio Cloud.

## Create your own copy of the tutorial project

To minimize any potential technical difficulties, I have created a project on
RStudio Cloud that contains the tutorial files and has all the necessary
packages already installed. To get started, go to
https://rstudio.cloud/project/1429887. This will automatically
create a copy of the project in your user workspace. Make sure to click the
button "Save a Permanent Copy", otherwise your copy of the project will be
deleted afterwards.
