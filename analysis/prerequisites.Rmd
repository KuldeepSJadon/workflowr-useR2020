To get the most out of attending this tutorial, it will help if you have previous experience with:

* Analyzing data with R in RStudio
* Knitting an R Markdown file in RStudio

## R and RStudio

The tutorial will take place within the RStudio IDE hosted on [RStudio Cloud][rscloud].
Thus it will be advantageous if you are already familiar with the basics of the
RStudio IDE.

In the top left is the editor pane. This is where you write your R code that is
saved to files on your computer.

In the bottom left is the R console. This is where your R code is executed. You
can either directly type commands into the R console, or you can send lines from
your scripts to be executed in the console with Ctrl/Cmd+Enter.

In the top right are various panes. Of particular interest are:

* Environment - this shows the objects that are currently defined in your R
session running in the R console

* History - this is the history of commands you have entered in the R console

* Git - This pane is only present if a Git repository is present. Thus you won't
see this until later in the tutorial when you create a workflowr project (which
creates a Git repository for you)

In the bottom right are various panes. Of particular interest:

* Files - The file explorer allows you to navigate directories on your machine
and perform common operations like renaming or moving a file. If you click on a
file, it will open in the editor pane.

* Plots - When you create a plot in the R console, it will be displayed in the
Plots pane

* Viewer - This displays web content like the HTML created from R Markdown files

A very useful feature for interactively exploring your data while simultaneously
recording your steps is the ability to send lines of code from the file open in
the Editor directly to the R console to be executed. You can do this by clicking
on the button "Run" or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+Enter.

In the gif below, I demonstrate both methods. First I define the vector `x` by
clicking the "Run" button. Notice how the Environment pane updates with the
newly defined object. Second I use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter to send the
second line of code to the R console. This plots a histogram of the data, which
is displayed in the Plots pane.

RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/index.html).

## Knit an R Markdown file in RStudio

When you open an R Markdown file in the editor pane, a button named "Knit" will
display. If you click on it, it will knit the document to HTML. You can view the
progress in the newly created "R Markdown" tab in the bottom left.

In the gif below, I click the "Knit" button to knit the R Markdown file. I
include the chunk `Sys.sleep(1)` so that it pauses long enough for you to see
the R Markdown pane appear.

Another option for running the code is to click on the button "Run". You can run
individual chunks or "Run All". Furthermore, just like R scripts, you can send
individual lines to the R console with Ctrl/Cmd+Enter.

In the gif below, I execute all the code chunks by clicking "Run All". Note that
before I do this, I instruct RStudio to send the chunk output to the R console
instead of displaying it inline. This makes it easier to interactively develop
the code in the R console and keeps the file uncluttered.

Lastly, it is important to understand how to interpret the error messages
produced when knitting R Markdown files, which you will use during the tutorial.

In the gif below, I knit an R Markdown file that produces an error trying to run
`log("a")`. The default view only displays the error message. I click on
"Output" to see the full log. This informs you the lines in the source R
Markdown file to check for the error. Importantly, it doesn't pinpoint the exact
line where the error occurred. Instead it reports the range of lines spanned by
the code chunk where the error occurred.
