# Literate programming with R Markdown

# Version control with Git

# Relative paths to files

# Setting the seed

# Record session information

# Don't save workspace

# How can workflowr help?

## R Markdown focused

## Automated version control

## Reproducibility safeguards

* Set the seed
* Run code in clean environment
* Record session information
* Warn if absolute paths are used
* Warn if results are from cached chunks
