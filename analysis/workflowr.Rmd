Now that you have the Spotify analysis running, you will create a workflowr
project to share the results and make sure it stays reproducible.
This is a modified version of the official workflowr vignette
[Getting started with workflowr][vig-getting-started].

[vig-getting-started]: https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html

Start by loading the workflowr package in the R console.

```{r package}
library(workflowr)
```

Workflowr uses Git to version all the changes to the code and results. For each
version it snapshots, Git requires a user name and email for attribution. Thus
before creating the workflowr project, tell Git your name and email address you
would like to use. It is convenient if the email address is the same one you
used to register with GitHub, but not required. This command only has to be run
once per computer (i.e. not every time you create a new workflowr project).

```{r git-config}
# Replace the example text with your information
wflow_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", user.email = "email@domain")
```

You can run `wflow_git_config()` again with no arguments to confirm that Git is
configured properly.

```{r git-config-confirm}
wflow_git_config()
```

Now that Git is configured, you can start your workflowr project using
`wflow_start()`. It is more common to start a workflowr proejct in a brand new
directory, but the workflowr setup can also be added to an existing analysis. To
limit the tutorial to one RStudio Cloud project, you will create the workflowr
project in the same directory where you've already been working on the Spotify
analysis.

The first argument to `wflow_start()` is the directory. The command below uses
the relative path `.`, which refers to the current working directory. In this
case it is equivalent to using the absolute path `/cloud/project/`. The second
argument is the name of the project, which will get displayed on the website.
And the third argument informs `wflow_start()` that the directory already
exists, since by default it expects to create a new one.

```{r start}
wflow_start(directory = ".", name = "Spotify song analysis", existing = TRUE)
```

That adds various files and directories. For the purpose of the tutorial, focus
on the following subset:

```
├── _workflowr.yml    # workflowr-specific settings
├── analysis/         # Rmd files
│   ├── index.Rmd     # Creates website homepage
│   └── _site.yml     # website-specific settings
├── data/             # data files
├── docs/             # website files
```

The most important thing to remember is to perform your analysis in Rmd files in
`analysis/`, and that the website files are saved in `docs/`.

To see the default state of the website, run `wflow_build()`. It will build all
the Rmd files currently in `analysis/` and save the HTML files in `docs/`. The
website will either pop up in a new window or be displayed in the Viewer pane.

```{r build}
wflow_build()
```

Conveniently, if you run it a second time, it does nothing because the Rmd files
have not changed since the last time the HTML files were built.

```{r build-nothing}
wflow_build()
```

Next add the Spotify analysis files to the workflowr project. You can do this
via the files Pane or the running the commands below in the R console. The Rmd
file goes to `analysis/` and the data file to `data/`.

```{r move-files}
file.rename("spotify.Rmd", "analysis/spotify.Rmd")
file.rename("spotify.csv", "data/spotify.csv")
```

And since `spotify.csv` is no longer in the same directory as `spotify.Rmd`,
you need to update the path passed to `read.csv()`. By default, all Rmd files
in a workflowr project are executed in the root of the project, so the updated
path is `data/spotify.csv`. Open `analysis/spotify.Rmd` and change the import
line to the line below:

```
spotify <- read.csv("data/spotify.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Run `wflow_build()` again. This will build `analysis/spotify.Rmd` and then open
the new file `docs/spotify.html`.

```{r build-spotify}
wflow_build()
```

Check the accuracy of the decision tree model and the random guessing model.
Did you obtain the same results as everyone?

This is because workflowr automatically sets the seed at the beginning of each
Rmd file. The default seed used for a project is the date in the format
`YYYYMMDD`. Open the file `_workflowr.yml` to confirm.

Also, you can look at the reproducibility report at the top of the file to see
the seed that is set and all the other reproducibility checks. The first check
is failing because the Rmd file hasn't been versioned with Git yet.




So far you've run `wflow_build()` multiple times. This builds the HTML files, but
it doesn't version anything with Git. Run `wflow_status()` to see the current
status of the Rmd files. The default Rmd files are "Unpublished" because they
have been versioned with Git, but not their HTML files. The new `spotify.Rmd` is
"Scratch" because its Rmd has not been versioned yet.

```{r status}
wflow_status()
```

There currently isn't a convenient way to navigate to the Spotify analysis on
the website. To fix this, open `analysis/index.Rmd`, add the line below, and
run `wflow_build()` again.

```
[Link to spotify analysis](spotify.html)
```

The line above is markdown syntax to create a link to the file `spotify.html`.

Now that the website is looking good, it is time to "publish" your results.

```{r publish}
wflow_publish(c("analysis/*Rmd", "data/spotify.csv"), "Add spotify analysis")
```

`wflow_publish()` performs three steps:

1. Commits the Rmd files and data file with Git
1. Executes the code to build the HTML files
1. Commits the HTML files with Git

Re-running `wflow_status()` shows that all the files are "published":

```{r status-2}
wflow_status()
```

Now that the files are committed in the Git repository, it's time to push them
to GitHub to share the analysis results.

Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) (you'll be prompted to
login first if needed) to create a new repository. In the box labeled
"Repository name", type "workflowr-spotify". Leave all the other settings as is,
and click on the button "Create repository".

Back in the R console, you need to inform Git of the GitHub repository you just
created. In Git terminology, a Git repository on a cloud service like GitHub is
called a "remote". Workflowr provides a convenience function `wflow_git_remote()`
to register remote repositores with Git. Run the command below using your GitHub
username:

```{r git-remote}
wflow_git_remote("origin", user = "<github-username>", repo = "workflowr-spotify")
```

Run `wflow_git_remote()` a second time, this time with no arguments, to have it
list the available remote repositories. The URL will look something like
`https://github.com/<github-username>/workflowr-spotify.git`.

```{r git-remote-confirm}
wflow_git_remote()
```

Note that "origin" is an alias for referring to that long URL. The name "origin"
is a convention, and could be anything you wanted. The main benefit of following
the convention is that it will make it easier to follow online 
troubleshooting resources.

Now that Git knows about the remote GitHub repository, push the project to
GitHub using `wflow_git_push()`. You'll be prompted to enter your GitHub
username in the R console followed by a secure popup menu for entering your
GitHub password.

```{r git-push}
wflow_git_push()
```

The updated GitHub repository will automatically open in a new tab. To activate
the website, navigate to the Settings tab and scroll down to the section "GitHub
Pages". Set the "Source" to "master branch /docs folder". After it automatically
updates, scroll back down to the same section to retreive the URL. It will look
like `https://<github-username>.github.io/workflowr-spotify/`. Click on it to
view your workflowr website. If it displays a "404 Not Found" error, manually
add `index.html` to the URL in the web browser (Long-term you don't have to do
this. It only applies when GitHub Pages is first launching your website).

Now you have a website that containing your reproducible results that you can
share with your colleagues! And each time you make changes and push them to
GitHub, the website will automatically update.
